# Hi, I’m Arsenic 👋

I build full-stack products that solve real problems.

I enjoy taking an idea, designing the flow, and shipping a working system —
from clean UI to backend logic and data handling.
Most of my work revolves around **JavaScript-based full-stack development** and
strengthening my fundamentals through **DSA and system thinking**.

I care about **clarity over complexity**: readable code, practical architecture,
and features that actually matter.
